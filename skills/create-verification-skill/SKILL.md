# Create a verification skill

Every serious project needs a scripted way to drive the real app and prove behavior:
launch it, exercise a feature the way a user would, and capture evidence. This skill
generates that as a project-local skill (`.agents/skills/verify-<app>/` in the target
repo) tailored to the codebase. Write the generator's output for the next agent rather
than for a human: it will be read cold, mid-task, by an agent that has never seen the app.

## 1. Interview the repo

Answer these from the codebase and only ask the user what you cannot observe:

- **Surface:** what does a user actually touch? A web UI, a CLI/TUI, a desktop app, an
  API, a mobile app, a library? A repo can have several, so pick the primary one and note
  the rest.
- **Run:** how does the app start locally? Prefer the repo's own documented dev command
  (package scripts, Makefile, README quickstart). Note ports, env vars, seed data, and
  auth.
- **Drive:** how can an agent interact with it programmatically? Check for existing
  harnesses first (Playwright or Cypress specs, expect scripts, PTY helpers, curl-able
  endpoints, a debug port), and only then pick a generic recipe: browser/CDP for web and
  Electron, a tmux/herdr or PTY harness for CLI/TUI, plain HTTP for services.
- **Observe:** what evidence can be captured? Screenshots, terminal transcripts, response
  bodies, logs, exit codes, DB state.
- **Isolate:** can two instances run side by side (ports, data dirs, profiles)? If not,
  say so in the generated skill: refusing to double-drive a shared instance beats
  corrupting the user's session.

If the checkout doesn't build or start as-is, fix that first (or report it precisely)
before generating, because a skill written against a broken base teaches wrong steps. When
an irrelevant missing asset blocks startup (a static dir the API never serves, a sample
config), the generated skill may create it, clearly marked as verification scaffolding,
and remove it in cleanup.

## 2. Generate the skill

Write `.agents/skills/verify-<app>/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name: verify-<app>`
and a quoted `description` that names the app, the surface, and when to reach for it;
without frontmatter the skill never registers) and these sections, each grounded in what
the interview actually found, with no placeholders left:

- **Launch:** the exact command that starts the app for verification, and how to tell it's
  ready (a log line, a port answering, a prompt). Include teardown. For a short-lived CLI
  or TUI there is no server to keep alive: launch means build the binary (or install deps)
  once, then start each drive in its own isolated PTY or tmux session.
- **Doctor:** one read-only check that answers "is this instance worth driving?", such as
  process up, right version or build, port owned by us, auth valid. An agent runs this
  first whenever anything looks off.
- **Drive:** the harness recipe with real selectors and commands from this repo rather
  than examples. Prefer stable handles (ARIA labels, data attributes, prompt strings,
  route paths) over coordinates and tab order. For a TUI whose rendering or feel needs the
  owner's eyes, point at the estate's `tui-live-review` skill as the escalation; this
  harness stays headless.
- **Evidence:** what to capture for a proof and where it goes. State the proof standards:
  exercise the real user path rather than internal setters or test-only endpoints; capture
  the action and the resulting state rather than only the final screen; verify side
  effects (files written, rows inserted, messages sent) alongside what's visible; mock
  only where a production boundary already isolates the external system. When the safe
  path is a dry-run or test mode, verify what it actually skips by observing files,
  network, and git refs rather than trusting its name, because some dry-runs still touch
  the network or open a browser.
- **Cleanup:** how to tear down instances the run created. Kill only what you started,
  never by process name. Cleanup removes instances and scratch state, never the evidence:
  proof artifacts survive the teardown, in a location the skill names.
- **Helpers:** any script the skill ships is executable and its invocation is shown in the
  skill body.

## 3. Seed the feature map

Create `.agents/skills/verify-<app>/features/README.md` plus one file per user-facing
feature you can identify, aiming for the top 3-5 to start, drawn from routes, commands,
menus, or docs. Follow the shape in
[`references/feature-map-example/`](references/feature-map-example/): a README index and
one file per feature. Each file answers, from the user's point of view: what the feature
is, how to reach it, how to drive it with the harness, and what observable end state
proves it works. The four H2s are `Sub-features`, `How to get to it (user POV)`, `Driving
it with <harness>`, and `Gotchas`. The map is the repo's maintained verification source,
so a proof that drives one convenient entry point is incomplete when the map lists others.

## 4. Prove the generated skill before handing it over

Run its own instructions end to end once: launch, doctor, drive ONE mapped feature (one is
enough, because the map exists so later runs can cover the rest), capture evidence, clean
up. After cleanup, confirm the evidence still exists at the named location; a cleanup that
eats the proof fails this step. Fix what fails, and run the generated cleanup after every
failed iteration too, so broken attempts don't strand processes and ports. A generated
skill that was never executed is a draft rather than a deliverable.

## 5. Offer the maintenance loop

Point the owner at the `maintain-verification-skill` skill for keeping the map honest as
the app changes. Suggest a cadence only if they ask.
